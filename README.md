# snake_game
This is classic mobile snake game of 90's played by everyone approximately.Now i made this game using data structures in java in which you can choose size of board of your choice
the basic theme of this game is there is a snake and the target is to eat more fruits without heating the boundary and without hitting itself.goal is to eat more fruits and when we
eat one fruit the size of snake is increased by one.and when the game is over by hitting wall and by hitting itself or by pressing key except(w for up,a for left,s for down,d for
right).
when game is over you can see your final score i.e how many ruits you eat.
